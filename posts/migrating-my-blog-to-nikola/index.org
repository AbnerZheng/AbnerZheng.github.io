Two years ago, I established my first blog, and wrote down somes articals to summarize my learning experience in Chinese. At that time, I use Jekyll with a theme forking from others. But nowadays, I fall in love with org-mode and Emacs. I try to schedule all my work and study with org-mode.

What's more, I also migrate my note system to org-mode. It's so amazing and comfortable to write and organize in its way, with high efficiency and beauty. And today, I finally migrate my blog to org-mode. And in order to practice my writing, I will start writing all my blog in English. I wish I would persist in bloging.
